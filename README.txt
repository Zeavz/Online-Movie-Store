This database project is implemented as a website and executes using files that consist of html, javascript, css, and php. 

The website is uploaded onto the Ryerson server as the following: 
http://www2.scs.ryerson.ca/~jpathman/510/ 
In order to access the website you must be connected to the network
Ryerson or RU-Secure or any such network that accepts the access Ryersonâ€™s www2 server. 

We used the IP address of Ryerson's network as the host for the connection so that any wireless device such as a laptop can be
connected to our database through the website.

A possible connection issue may occur if Ryerson renews the IP address.

found in file "connect.php" from the line "Host=141.117.57.159" to "Host=oracle.scs.ryerson.ca".
